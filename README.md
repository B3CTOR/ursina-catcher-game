## General info

This is a (very) little game made with Python 3.9 and the free and open source engine Ursina.

I have tried to convert the .py file with all the assets into a single .exe file but I couldn't, if you download the program and convert it into a one .exe file successfuly contact please contact me.

## Technologies

The following package was used in this game:

- Ursina
```
$ pip install ursina
```
https://www.ursinaengine.org/


This is the game engine used in this project.

Note: To use this package, you will need Python 3.6+

- Graphics

To make the pixel-art graphics I used the following website:

- Sounds

To make the sounds I used the following software:

## Setup

As I said I couldn't convert the game into a single .exe program, so the following way is the onle one:
```
$ python game.py
```
